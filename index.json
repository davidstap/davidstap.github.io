It is useful to steer the image generation process for purposes such as content creation. This can be done by conditioning the model on additional information. However, when conditioning on additional information, there still exists a large set of images that agree with a particular conditioning. This makes it unlikely that the generated image is exactly as envisioned by a user, which is problematic for practical content creation scenarios such as generating facial composites or stock photos.  To solve this problem, we propose a single pipeline for text-to-image generation and manipulation. In the first part of our pipeline we introduce textStyleGAN, a model that is conditioned on text. In the second part of our pipeline we make use of the pre-trained weights of textStyleGAN to perform semantic facial image manipulation. The approach works by finding semantic directions in latent space. We show that this method can be used to manipulate facial images for a wide range of attributes. Finally, we introduce the CelebTD-HQ dataset, an extension to CelebA-HQ, consisting of faces and corresponding textual descriptions.

Gamification deploys game mechanics to increase motivation and thereby boost the learning process. In our work, we use learning analytics to implement game mechanics that create a motivating learning experience. The educational context concerns students that engage in model-building to develop systems thinking expertise. Three mechanics have been implemented: badges, leaderboard and life. The gamification add-on was evaluated during high school physics classes. Data mining showed that gamification resulted in significantly higher self-reported scores on enjoyment but inferior student-created models. A strong correlation between delete-behaviour and correctness of the created models was also found.","tags":[],"title":"Gamification for learning by modelling in interactive learning environments","type":"publication"}]
